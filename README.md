##About Window Cleaner

Project source code for the game Window Cleaner, by Wesley Wilson. Built with Unity3D. Hoping someone will get around to porting it to Oculus Rift, because that would be amazing.

Window Cleaner is an interactive videogame with a strong focus on ambience and environmental design. It has exhibited in Germany, New York, and Chicago, and has received some acclaim from the weirder (mostly German) game critics.
